# Lab: FizzBuzz (It's a classic!)

###### Delivery Method: Doctests

--------------

##### Goal

Write a function that that outputs a list of the result up to value `n`.

--------------------

##### Instructions

Here are the rules for the FizzBuzz problem:

Given the length of the output of numbers from 1 - n:
If a number is divisible by 3, append "Fizz" to a list.
If a number is divisible by 5, append "Buzz" to that same list.
If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, append "FizzBuzz" to the list.
If a number meets none of theese rules, just append the string of the number.

Append each value to a list starting with 1, and ending at `n` and return the resulting list.
