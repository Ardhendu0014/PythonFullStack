# Lab: Shrink!

###### Delivery Method: Doctests

--------------

##### Goal

Write three functions to satisfy the doctest's expected output.  Find the sum of each number in a string.

If the result is a more than one digit number, continue to find resulting sums until the output is a single digit int.


--------------------

##### Instructions

For example: `1 + 2 + 3 + 5` = `11`
Thats still more than one digit!

Repeat the same process with the result
11 is two digits so, `1 + 1` = `2`

#### Documentation

1. [Python Official: List Methods](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)

-----------------------

#### Advanced

- Implement a recusive solution, by writing a function that calls itself to create an implied looping condition.  Discuss this with the instructor.

----------------------

#### Key Concepts

- Built-In functions
- Recursion
- `while` looping
