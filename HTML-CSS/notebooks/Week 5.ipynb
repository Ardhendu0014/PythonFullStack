He wanted there to be as little friction as possible for people to be able to publish their content, so he intentionally made the language less strict than it could have been. This design decision seems to have paid off.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML being a permissive language is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it means your content is likely to be at least mostly usable/readable even if your markup is not perfect. On the other hand, it can be harder to find and fix problems in your markup because they won’t always show up as errors when you view your pages.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Identifying Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Many errors in HTML are the result of one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Forgetting the ending tag (e.g., leaving off `</a>`)\n",
    "- A missing `\"` on an attribute value (e.g., `<a href=\"foo>foo</a>`)\n",

    "- Incorrectly nested tags (e.g., `<em><strong></em></strong>`)\n",

    "His point is that in many ways it doesn’t matter how elegant and efficient the code underlying a website or application is. If the UI is crappy or ill-conceived, users will not (want to) use it. To the user, the interface is what they see, what they interact with. To users, the interface _is_ the application.\n",

    "Cascading Style Sheets is used to implement style and design. Its capabilities are vast, but its semantics can be confusing. We will focus on the major concepts, then get familiar with some tools to make building great websites dead simple.\n",

It’s possible to build complex web applications entirely using JavaScript, from the backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB) to the frontend (React, Angular, Ember). For purposes of this course, we will be using JavaScript to [enhance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement) our web pages with behaviors that improve the user experience.\n",

    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Tags Work\n",
    "\n",
    "[HTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/) describes a set of “tags” that can be used to add [semantic infromation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML) to the content of web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <h1>My Headline</h1>\n",
    "    <p>This is my <em>awesome</em> paragraph of text.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, `<h1></h1>` is a **header** tag. The text, `My Headline`, is the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, `<p></p>` is a **paragraph** tag. The text, `This is my awesome paragraph of text.`, is the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `<em></em>` tag adds **emphasis** to the word “awesome” in our sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most tags (with a few exceptions) are structured like this, with an **opening** and **closing** tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "In HTML documents, web browsers treat any number of consecutive whitespace characters (i.e. spaces, newlines, and tabs) as a single space. Because of this behavior, if we took out the tags around the content above, it would render like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    My Headline This is my awesome paragraph of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s the tags that tell the browser to render our example like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "# My Headline\n",
    "\n",
    "This is my _awesome_ paragraph of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Moar Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML provides tags for a host of common semantics. These give the content structure and meaning. Always try to [find and use a semantic tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) if one is available for what you’re trying to convey.\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Headers\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML describes 6 levels of headers (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, … `<h6>`). This number of headers is a remnant from the original use case of scientific papers, but it’s adequate for most situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <h1>My Headline</h1>\n",
    "    <h2>My Sub-Headline</h2>    \n",
    "    <h3>My Sub-Sub-Headline</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Web browsers render the above as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "# My Headline\n",
    "## My Sub-Headline\n",
    "### My Sub-Sub-Headline\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Paragraphs\n",
    "\n",
    "The `<p></p>` tag might be the most common tag on the web. It is used to contain a paragraph of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <p>\n",
    "        This is my paragraph of text. It is my\n",
    "        favorite because I wrote it. I can make\n",

    "### Emphasis\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two levels of emphasis you can add to words in HTML: _emphasis_ and **strong emphasis.**\n",

    "_Note: This is one of the tags in HTML that does not require a closing tag. I.e. there is no such thing as `</img>`._\n",

    "- `alt` — Alternative text for the image that will be read by screen readers\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: It may be appropriate to leave it empty if the image is purely decorative, but you **always** need to include the `alt` attribute in your `<img>` tags!_\n",
    "\n",
    "Images are sometimes put in `<figure></figure>` containers when they are intended to convey some important content, such as a chart or code snippet. In those cases, they will usually be coupled with a `<figcaption></figcaption>` element that provides a textual description of the illustration.\n",

    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content structure\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few tags you can use to describe your content’s high-level structure. These typically don’t add much in the way of styling information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <!-- self-contained piece of the document -->\n",
    "    <article></article>\n",
    "\n",
    "    <!-- container for a section of content -->\n",
    "    <section></section>\n",
    "\n",
    "    <!-- generic container for content -->\n",
    "    <div></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the above has an intended use, but in practice these tags can often be used interchangeably.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML provides specific tags for common semantics related to headers, navigation, and footers on a web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <header>\n",
    "        <h1>My Page’s Header</h1>\n",
    "        <nav>\n",

    "    <footer>\n",
    "        <p>My page’s footer.</p>\n",
    "    </footer>\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the following tags describe sub-sets of the content:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <!-- content tangential to main content -->\n",
    "    <aside></aside>\n",
    "\n",
    "    <!-- container for an image, diagram, or code snippet\n",
    "         usually with a caption -->\n",
    "    <figure></figure>\n",

    "Putting all of these together, the content for a page might be structured something like the following:\n",
