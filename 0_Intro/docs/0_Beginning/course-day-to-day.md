# Day-to-Day
The flow of the course day will look like:

1. Lecture
1. Demo
1. 15 minute break
1. Practice
1. 5 minute break
1. Wrap up

## Standup

**Standup** is a quick meeting each evening at 6 PM where each person recounts to the group:

* What they worked on the previous day
* Any problems they need help resolving
* What they plan on doing today

The point of standup is to ensure that everyone is being productive and not blocked.
Feel free to directly ask others for help during this time.

Each person should take **no more than 30 seconds**.
We will literally stand to make sure you go quickly.

## Practice

During time allocated to work on practice problems, I will be coming around and answering questions and giving you informal feedback on your code.
Get my attention immediately if you do have a question.

You are welcome to share your practice solutions or help your fellow students with practice problems at any time.

### Group Practices

Group practice problems are worked on in groups of about three students.
I will assign groups such that you will work with everyone about equally throughout the course.

Please observe [good group working philosophy](/Additional/Interpersonal\ Skills/group-work.md).

### Individual Practice

Individual practice problems are worked on by students who finish the checked problems before they are due or want more practice.
I will not be checking solutions, but I am happy to look at them if you ask.

## One-on-Ones

Every Friday I can do **one-on-ones**.
They are a meeting where we can discuss anything at all!
