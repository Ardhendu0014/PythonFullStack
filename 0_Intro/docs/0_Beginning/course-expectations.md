# Course Expectations

This is an immersive, hands-on educational experience that mimics and prepares you for the on-the-job learning you will _have to do continually_ as a top professional software developer.

The class is for motivated, independent learners who are looking for structure, guidance, and access to professional expertise.

**Do not expect a high school or community college class.**
There is minimal lecture.
There is a focus on practicality and delivering results, not studying concepts.

## Resources

Ask Questions!

Feel free to get my attention _at any time_ if you have a question.

You are an amazing resource.
Your fellow students are also an amazing resource, Ask them questions.

Prioritize teaching others in the class with every interaction.
Teaching is the best way to solidify your own understanding.

Outside-of-class tutoring is free and can be scheduled with the instructional staff.

## The Twelve Minute Rule

1. Attempt to solve the problem for 12 minutes.
2. Ask for Help.


## Commitment

The course is full-time and very fast moving.
**Cherish your time in class!**
Most of the class time will be allotted to working on problems individually, interpersonally or in groups.
**This class will require work outside of the alloted class time.**
Spend some time reviewing and studying up every evening and weekend.

### Embrace Mistakes and Feedback

Nobody is perfect, especially when you're starting something new!
Embrace failure as much as possible, there's a saying "Fail fast, and fail early."
Online resources will be your savior! (Search for errors or behavior you want to achieve.)
__THE 12 MINUTE RULE__ (Don't burn yourself out.)
Your fellow students and I are always here for feedback and retort.

### Be Precise and Flexible Simultaneously

Computers are unforgiving.
They have a very small set of low-level operations and require you to use them precisely.
**Cultivate an attention to detail.**

On the other hand, the mid and high-level structure you use to solve your problem is totally self-imposed.  Learn to read other people's structures and come up with ones that fit your problem.

### Thinking Like A Programmer
Every problem you encounter can be reduced into smaller problems.
**Notice and practice this skill.**
